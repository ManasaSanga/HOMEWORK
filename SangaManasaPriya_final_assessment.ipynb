    "### Q1: What is Machine Leanring?\n",
    "A stream of research of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science called machine learning . It mainly focuses on using data and algorithms to simulate how humans learn, gradually increasing the accuracy of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is important because it allows businesses see patterns in customer activity, operational behaviour and facilitates the development of new products. Machine learning is a key component of the operations of many of today's top corporations, including Facebook, Google, and Uber. For many businesses, machine learning now significantly differentiates them from their competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: What are the key principles of 'Supervised' Machine learning?\n",
    "The key principle behind supervised learning models is that we construct them using data that contains values for all of the model's inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We require a data collection with information on income and the other demographic parameters for a large number of people in order to create a supervised learning model for an income problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A supervised learning model will investigate the correlation between each individual's input and output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, it creates a mathematical formula that connects the inputs and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: With regards to Machine Learning Model Fitting, what do we mean my Underfitting and Overfitting?\n",
    "Overfitting and underfitting are the two biggest causes for poor performance of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "Overfitting in machine learning:\n",
    "When a model fits the training data too well, it is said to be overfit.\n",
    "When a model learns the information and noise in the training data to the point where it adversely affects the model's performance on fresh data, this is known as overfitting. This indicates that the machine learns concepts from the noise or random oscillations in the training data. These ideas don't apply to fresh data, which poses a difficulty for the models' capacity to generalise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonparametric and nonlinear models, which have more flexibility while learning a target function, are more likely to exhibit overfitting. To limit and constrain how much detail the model learns, several nonparametric machine learning algorithms also contain parameters or strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, decision trees are a nonparametric machine learning technique that can overfit training data and is very versatile. After a tree learns, it can be pruned to remove part of the detail it has absorbed to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting in machine learning\n",
    "A model is said to be underfit when it is unable to both model the training data and generalise to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine learning model that is underfit is not appropriate and will be visible since it will perform poorly on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since underfitting is simple to identify with a strong performance metric, it is frequently not emphasised. Moving on and experimenting with other machine learning methods is the solution. However, it does offer a useful counterpoint to the overfitting issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: Explain how do we ususally split data in preparation for the Machine Learning process?\n",
    "The Purpose of splitting data into the different category is to avoid overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethically, it is suggested to divide your dataset into three parts to avoid overfitting and model selection bias called -\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Training set (Has to be the largest set)\n",
    "2.Cross-Validation set or Development set or Dev set\n",
    "3.Testing Set\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training set\n",
    "The actual subset of the dataset that we utilise to train the model, or the sample of data that was used to fit the model (estimating the weights and biases in the case of Neural Network). This data is observed, the model learns from it, and its parameters are optimised.\n",
    "2. Cross validation set\n",
    "We select the appropriate model or the degree of the polynomial (if using regression model only) by minimizing the error on the cross-validation set.\n",
    "3.test set\n",
    "the subset of data that was used to impartially assess how well a final model fit the training dataset. Once the model has fully trained using the training and validation sets, it is only used. Therefore, the test set is used to simulate the kind of circumstance that will be encountered after the model is made available for use in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the data is splited into ratios\n",
    "\n",
    "The key goal of choosing the splitting ratio is to ensure that the overall trend of our original dataset is present in all three sets. It is feasible that we will choose a model that is skewed towards the patterns found solely in the dev set if our dev set contains very little data. The same is true for training sets; too little data will cause the model to be biassed toward certain trends that are unique to that subset of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models we use are merely estimators that are trained to recognise statistical patterns in the data. Therefore, it is crucial that the statistical distributions of the data used to learn and those used to validate or test the model are as close as possible. Choosing the subsets — in this case, the training set, the development set, and/or the test set — at random is one approach to accomplish this as perfectly as you can. The properties of the train set and the dev/test set will not match, for instance, if you are working on a face identification project and the dev/test images were acquired from a user's cell phone while the training images were taken from the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the train test split method twice is one technique to partition the dataset into the train, test, and cv with 0.6, 0.2, and 0.2 ratios:\n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split \n",
    "x, x_test, y, y_test = train_test_split (x_train,labels, test_size=0.2, train_size=0.8 )\n",
    "x_train, x_cv, y_train, y_cv = train_test_split(x,y,test_size = 0.25, train_size =0.75)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: What is SciKit?\n",
    "Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. Through a consistent Python interface, it offers a variety of effective methods for statistical modelling and machine learning, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. This Python-based library is based on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.\n"
